# Pentago
An implementation of the existing Pentago game where you need to get 5 marbles in a row (in any direction) on a board that consists of four 3x3 grids. The game is built with React, using Redux as its state management system. An extremely basic AI is included, but do not expect it to be very clever :-)

## Build & Run
```
1. npm install
2. npm build
3. npm install -g serve
4. serve -s build
5. Navigate to the given address (e.g., localhost:5000).
```

# Preview
Below is a preview of the game, showing AI vs AI with faster animations than usual. Note, actual game will run at 60 FPS. This is an extremely low FPS gif file.
